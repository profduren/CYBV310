Coding Exercises 2 - Course Week 3

1.  Write a program that counts to ten.  The program must print each value, so the output of the program should look like this:

Starting:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
Done!

The function MUST use a for loop and a counter to print the values.

Copy the .c file from your project and turn it is as HW2_1.c.


2. In C, one function can call another. Write a program that calls a function named one_three(). This function should display 
the word one on one line, call a second function named two(), and then display the word three on one line. The function two() 
should display the word two on one line. The main() function should display the phrase starting now: before calling one_three() 
and display done! after calling it. Thus, the output should look like the following: 

	Starting: 
	one
	two
	three 
	Done! 

Copy the .c file from your project and turn it is as HW2_2.c.



3. Write a program which prints the sizes (in bytes) of the data types using the sizeof() function:

	printf("sizeof(char) = %u\n", sizeof(char));

for all of the native types in C:

	char
	unsigned char
	short
	unsigned short
	int
	unsigned int
	long
	unsigned long
	float
	double

Copy the .c file from your project and turn it is as HW2_3.c.


4. Using the CertificateUtilities.c program from assignment 1, instead of storing the RDN values using individual variables in main(), 
use the following structure to hold the RDN values:

typedef struct
{
    char commonName[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
    char organization[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
    char country[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
    char organizationUnit[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
    char locality[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
    char state[MAX_RDN_LENGTH];
} DistinguishedName;

You may declare the structure on the stack or globally in the data segment.  Instead of printing the distinguished name in main, write 
a function that will print the DN.  The function MUST take a pointer to the DistinguishedName structure as a parameter:

    	void PrintDistinguishedName(DistinguishedName *pDN);

Copy the .c file from your project and turn it is as HW2_4.c.
